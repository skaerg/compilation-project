# The Flap Compiler Test Suite

This test suite contains a variety of files designed to exercise each pass of
the flap compiler.

To run all the test suite, simply run `make` in its top-level directory.

Use `make PASS.results` to only run the tests contained in the directory `PASS`,
e.g., use `make 01-Parsing.results` to only run the parsing tests.
